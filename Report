**# Reddit Public Activity Analyzer & Subreddit Recommendation Engine**

## Introduction
The Reddit Public Activity Analyzer & Subreddit Recommendation Engine is a browser extension designed to fetch a user's **public Reddit activity** (posts, comments, upvotes) and generate **personalized subreddit recommendations**. The goal is to help users discover new subreddits that align with their interests.

## Data Collection & Processing
### 1 Fetching Public Activity
- The extension utilizes "Reddit’s OAuth API" to authenticate users and fetch their **public activity**.
- The following endpoints are used:
  -  Fetches user posts.
  -  Fetches user comments.
  -  Fetches upvoted posts.
- The API requests are made using fetch() with authentication headers containing the access token.

### 2 Data Storage & Preprocessing
- The retrieved data is stored in Chrome’s local storage.
- Text preprocessing is applied to extract relevant keywords and themes.
- Stopwords removal is performed to clean up unnecessary words (e.g., "the", "is", "and").

##  Activity Analysis Logic
### 1 Identifying User Interests
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
  - Extracts the most relevant keywords from posts and comments.
  - Helps identify frequently discussed topics by the user.
- Subreddit Frequency Analysis:
  - Counts how often the user interacts with different subreddits.
  - Assigns weights based on engagement levels (more posts/comments → higher importance).

### 2 Ranking Interests Using PageRank Approach
- A graph-based ranking method is applied to determine the most important keywords.
- Each subreddit is treated as a node, and interactions form edges.
- Higher-ranked subreddits influence recommendations more.

## Subreddit Recommendation Algorithm
### 1 Finding Similar Subreddits
- The system leverages Reddit’s API to find related subreddits.
- The most frequently interacted subreddits are used as input queries to find similar communities.

### 2 Filtering & Ranking Recommendations
- Recommendations are ranked based on content similarity, using:
  - Jaccard Similarity: Measures overlap between user interests and subreddit topics.
  - Cosine Similarity: Analyzes the similarity of the user’s discussion topics with recommended subreddits.
  - Popularity & Activity Metrics: Subreddits with high engagement and active discussions are prioritized.

### 3 Final Recommendation List
- A Top-N ranking is generated, displaying the best-matching subreddits.
- Users can click on recommendations to visit the subreddit directly.

## Privacy & Compliance
- The extension only accesses publicly available data.
- OAuth tokens are used temporarily and not saved persistently.

## Conclusion
The extension provides an intelligent way to analyze a user’s Reddit activity and recommend new subreddits tailored to their interests. By leveraging NLP techniques and similarity algorithms, the system ensures **relevant, high-quality recommendations** while maintaining user privacy.
